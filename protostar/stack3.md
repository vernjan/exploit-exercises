# Stack3

## About
Stack3 looks at environment variables, and how they can be set, and overwriting function pointers stored on the stack (as a prelude to overwriting the saved EIP)

Hints
- both `gdb` and `objdump` is your friend you determining where the `win()` function lies in memory.

## Source code
```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void win()
{
  printf("code flow successfully changed\n");
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int (*fp)();
  char buffer[64];

  fp = 0;

  gets(buffer);

  if(fp) {
      printf("calling function pointer, jumping to 0x%08x\n", fp);
      fp();
  }
}
```

---

Overflow `buffer[64]` with the memory address of the `win()` function:
```shell script
# TODO
# code flow successfully changed 
```
